These are my solutions to the Advent of Code 2018 challenge. I decided to attempt this in Java, a language I have always struggled with. So far this has been at least 50% "coding by Stack Overflow," so I have left comments in the code when something I copied and pasted worked but I wasn't sure why. I welcome anyone's critiques. The Java idiom is mostly foreign to me, so go easy :)
